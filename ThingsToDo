Things To Do: 

1) Implement Leapfrog integration
2) More particles 
3) Explore rendering options (marching cubes or point splatting)
4) Reset system
5) Turn off density rendering
6) Two sets of particles with different rest densities 
7) POSSIBLY switch between Euler and Leapfrog 
8) Wall particles
9) Rotational force 
10) Presentation stuff: 

- Examples to run 
- Slides (a few) 
- Practice 

10) Writeup
