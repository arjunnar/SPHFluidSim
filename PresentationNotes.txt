Before all this, make the floor/background look better if possible.

1) 2D Large Dam Break 
- Two rendering modes, first particles and then marching cubes (< 25 seconds)
2) 3D Simple and Rotation ( < 25 seconds)
- Show it drop, then show slow rotation and amp the rotation speed
- Start with particles and then switch to marching cubes (we will press marching cubes mid-way through the slow rotation) 
3) Particle Emitters ( < 15 seconds)
-Just show it for fun 
4) Two density ( < 15 seconds)
5) 3D Large (with a wider tank) and then a spherical droplet going in. 
- Only render with particles. ( 35 seconds )
- Actually, if there's time, try marching cubes
